Attached is the PowerShell script to remove the expired certs on IBM DataPower Gateway. You must use version 7.3.5 and above(the latest version is recommended). If you are not sure about what version you have, you can run the following command "$PSVersionTable".
If you encounter any Microsoft or PowerShell related errors, run the command "Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass" in the terminal before you run the script.
